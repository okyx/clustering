# clustering

There are many clustering algorithm such as: <br>
- K-means <br>
- SOM 
- GMM
<h1>K-Means</h1>
this method is the one of the oldest method and very popular <br>
this algorithm has steps like below :<br>
1. initialize centroid (the number of centroid is same as how many class you want and the dimension is same like input dimension).<br>
2. calculate the ecluidean distance the equation is below, and the nearest one is the class of centroid<br>
3. calculate the mean of the data and that's a new centroid<br>
4. do this unill convergence<br>

<h1>SOM</h1>
SOM (Self Orginizing map) or Kohonen Maps is one of ANN

<h1>GMM</h1>
GMM uses EM approcah , so there is Expectation step and Maximization step
