# clustering

There are many clustering algorithm two of them are: <br>
- K-means <br>
- SOM 

<h1>K-Means</h1>
this method is the one of the oldest method and very popular 
this algorithm has steps like below :
1. initialize centroid (the number of centroid is same as how many class you want and the dimension is same like input dimension).
2. calculate the ecluidean distance the equation is below, and the nearest one is the class of centroid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sqrt{\sum&space;(centroid-x)})
1. calculate the mean of the data and that's a new centroid
2. do this unill convergence
